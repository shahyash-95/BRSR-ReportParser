PRINCIPLE 9: BUSINESSES SHOULD ENGAGE WITH AND PROVIDE VALUE TO THEIR,
CONSUMERS IN A RESPONSIBLE MANNER,
Essential Indicators,
1. Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.,
"To ensure customer grievances are redressed promptly and effectively, the Corporation has put in place a grievance",
redressal policy and has a centralised team called Customer Engagement which is responsible for managing customer,
grievances. The team works closely with the management and various vertical teams and provides regular feedback,
"on process, policies and people related complaints. This leads to improvements and ensures complaints are reduced.",
"The Corporation has a digital complaint management platform to upload, respond and monitor customer grievances.",
Grievance Redressal Mechanism: Key Highlights,
i. Easy upload and creation of complaints,
"All complaints received from website, emails and social media are auto uploaded on the complaint management",
platform. The complaint letters/emails are scanned/uploaded by the central team and branch employees. Complaints,
"received from the regulator, National Consumer Helpline and the government are downloaded from their respective",
platforms and assigned by central team.,
"ii. Verification of customer credentials, customer information security",
Customer posting complaints from the website need to authenticate their customer credentials via a one-time,
"password. On social media, customer credentials are verified using a direct/private message. Thereafter, the",
complaints of verified customers are auto uploaded on the complaint management platform. Responses to customer,
complaints are sent to the registered email ids to ensure customer information security.,
iii. Complaint ID acknowledgement mail and advisory to customers,
Complaints are uploaded on the complaint management platform and an acknowledgement,email is sent
immediately to the customer with an assurance that there will be a response within 7 working days.,
iv. Assignment of Complaints,
"Complaints are assigned depending on the category of the complaint. As per the grievance redressal policy, the",
Corporation has an assignment matrix to ensure complaints are resolved effectively and promptly. Escalated,
complaints to management and under certain category are assigned and responded by Customer Engagement,
team.,
v. Monitoring and Analysing Complaints,
The customer engagement team carries out root cause analysis on a regular basis. Feedback is given to the,
"management, vertical teams and branches to ensure complaints are not repeated. This leads to improvement in",
"process, policy and people development.",
"The customer engagement team monitors pendency and quality of responses, shares MIS and analysis of complaints",
5. Does the entity have a framework/ policy on cyber security and risks related to data privacy? (Yes/No) If
"available, provide a web-link of the policy."
"Yes. The Corporation has in place board approved policies such as Cyber Security Policy, Social Media Security Policy"
and Information Security Policy to ensure sufficient safeguards are in place to prevent any data leakage. The policies
"are also aligned with the Master Direction – Information Technology Framework for the NBFC Sector, ISO 27001 and the"
National Institute of Standards & Technology guidelines.
The Corporation has also constituted an Information Security Steering Committee (ISSC) to monitor the progress and
"status about Information and Cyber Security. Further, the Corporation has also constituted an Information Technology"
"(IT) Strategy Committee comprising two independent directors, a whole-time director and few senior officials of the"
Corporation which assess the implementation of cyber and information security.
The policy is available to internal stakeholders and is placed on the intranet of the Corporation.
6. Provide details of any corrective actions taken or underway on issues relating to advertising and delivery of
essential services; cyber security and data privacy of customers; re-occurrence of instances of product recalls;
penalty/action taken by regulatory authorities on safety of products/services.
